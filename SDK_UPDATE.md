# Firebase MCP Server: SDK Update to v1.7.0

This document describes the changes made to update the Firebase MCP Server to use the latest @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v1.7.0.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Updated Server Implementation**:
   - Migrated from the low-level `Server` class to the new simplified `McpServer` API
   - Added Zod schema validation for tool parameters
   - Improved error handling and response formatting

2. **Added Response Adapter**:
   - Created a response adapter to maintain backward compatibility with existing client implementations
   - The adapter converts the old response format to the new format expected by the McpServer API

3. **Package Dependencies**:
   - Updated @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to v1.7.0
   - Added explicit dependency on zod for schema validation

## File Changes

1. **src/index.ts**:
   - Complete rewrite to use the McpServer API
   - Added Zod schemas for input validation
   - Improved error handling

2. **src/lib/response-adapter.ts**:
   - New file that adapts responses from the client implementation files to the format expected by the McpServer API

3. **package.json**:
   - Updated @modelcontextprotocol/sdk dependency to v1.7.0
   - Added zod dependency
   - Incremented version number to 1.1.0

## Benefits of the Update

1. **Improved Type Safety**:
   - Zod schemas provide runtime type checking and validation
   - TypeScript integration is improved with the new API

2. **Better Developer Experience**:
   - Simplified API is easier to understand and maintain
   - Express-like syntax for defining tools

3. **Future Compatibility**:
   - Aligned with the latest MCP protocol standards
   - Prepared for upcoming features and improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the updated implementation with Claude desktop, Cursor.ai, and other MCP clients
   - Verify that all tools work correctly
